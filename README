ClickNLoad2text

A simple Python script to display the contents of Click'n'Load[1] links.

Requirements:
 * Python 3
 * OpenSSL
 * A JavaScript interpreter.
   Node is the default, but anything that can evaluate JavaScript should work.
   You might have to modify the jk_eval() function in the script to suit your
   needs.

Usage:
Start the script before opening a web page containing the Click'n'Load link.
The script will start a small web server listening on port 9666 to handle the
requests required for Click'n'Load to work. Accessing the link opens a page
displaying the contents of the Click'n'Load link.
The contents will additionally be printed to stdout.

Notes:
NoScript and similar tools might warn you about a Cross Site Scripting attack
when accessing Click'n'Load links. This is due to the design of Click'n'Load.
